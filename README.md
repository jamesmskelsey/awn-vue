# awn-vue

This Vue.js/Firebase single page application was developed to make up for
the deficiencies of existing Navy software. Accepts data from a maintenance data system,
processes it, stores it in a database, and presents it to the user. [Live Example](https://essex-awn.web.app/)

Load WN_ADHOC.csv files with this app for a sample.
